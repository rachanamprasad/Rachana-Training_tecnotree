    <h1>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <p>
        APJ Abdul Kalam was not only a great scientist with a beautiful mind,
        but also a great human being with exceptional thoughts and amazing ideas
        to change the way mankind thinks. The 'Missile man of India', sadly, is 
        no more with us, but his teachings and ideas will remain alive throughout!!
