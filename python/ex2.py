# //Here, we define a class called BankAccount with an __init__ method to initialize the balance to 0. We then define three methods:

# deposit(amount): Adds the specified amount to the balance and prints a message confirming the deposit.
# withdraw(amount): Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if there is enough balance, and prints a message confirming the withdrawal. If there is not enough balance, it prints an error message.
# print_balance(): Prints the current balance.

# //We can create an instance of the BankAccount class and call its methods like this:
# create an instance of BankAccount
account = BankAccount()

# deposit some money
account.deposit(1000)

# withdraw some money
account.withdraw(500)

# try to withdraw more money than the balance
account.withdraw(1000)

# print the balance
account.print_balance()
