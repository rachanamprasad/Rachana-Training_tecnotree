# //example of a simple decorator that prints a message before and after 

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function is called.")

# //Explaination:
# //After the function is called.
# //In the above example, my_decorator() is a function that takes another function as input and returns a new function (wrapper()) that
# //modifies the behavior of the original function (say_hello()). 
# //When we call say_hello(), the modified function is executed, and the message is printed before and after the original function is called.
