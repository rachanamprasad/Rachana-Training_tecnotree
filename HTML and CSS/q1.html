		<h2>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
		<p>
            APJ Abdul Kalam was not only a great scientist with a beautiful mind,
            but also a great human being with exceptional thoughts and amazing ideas
            to change the way mankind thinks. The 'Missile man of India', sadly, is 
            no more with us, but his teachings and ideas will remain alive throughout!!
            APJ Abdul Kalam was one of the most adored personalities across the country 
            and everyone has been mourning over the huge loss and has been sending
             condolences.

            A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, 
            (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong),
             Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development
            of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India 
            from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from
            the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research
            and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space 
            Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first 
            satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining 
            DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful
             missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes
              was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated 
              aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the
            Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development 
            Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after
            becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started 
            his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice 
            of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the 
            renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by 
            H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station
            (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
             (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in 
             July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
              independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's 
              approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers
